Insurance Claim Form Chatbot
This project features an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users in filing insurance claims by gathering required details and automatically filling out a claim form. Using advanced NLP models like transformers and a retrieval-based knowledge base, the chatbot guides users through the form-filling process, captures essential information, and populates fields based on user responses. Gradio provides the interactive interface, making it easy for users to interact with the bot in a conversational manner. This solution aims to simplify and speed up the claims process, reducing the manual effort required in form completion.
